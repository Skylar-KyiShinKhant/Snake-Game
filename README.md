## About The Project
### Game Instructions

Snake Movement: Use the __Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)__ to navigate the green snake.

Objective: Guide the snake to eat the red apples.

Scoring: Each time the snake consumes an apple, your score increases by 1.

Avoid Collisions: Be cautious not to hit the boundaries, as it results in the end of the game.

Self-Biting: If the snake bites its own tail, the game ends.

Enjoy the game!
